# Phantom Armor
This datapack for Minecraft 1.21.5+ lets you make your armor (or elytra) invisible by applying phantom membrane to it in a smithing table!

  *Disabled*: armor will never be revealed when taking damage

  *Anything*: armor will always be revealed when taking damage
- Reveal armor with invisibility effect: if enabled, players with the invisibilty effect will have their armor revealed
